In this representation, I used "item" attribute links when linking to an individual movie from
the larger movie list. I used "related" when linking from an individual movie back to 
 the larger movie list. I've linked the movie resource to the show times
 resource using a "related" link as well. And again, when linking out of
 the showings resource, I use a "related" link. 
 
 I used the microdata data type, following data types found on www.schema.org .
 I used the following properties and types found on schema.org :
 
 **Title**: Something to identify movies. Pairs with an id to make sure each entry is unique.
 
 **Description:** a short description of movies
 
 **Duration:** How long the movie lasts. Can also be thought of as runtime.
 
 **Rating**: An MPAA rating, on a scale of G, PG, PG-13, R
 
 **Showing**: What time(s) the movie will be shown.
 
 **Licence**: Whether or not the theather has the licence to show something.
